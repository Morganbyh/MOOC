# Mining precedence relations among lecture videos in MOOCs via concept prerequisite learning

**The following data set is the 6.2 section of the paper. The data set of the precedence relation voting results for the lecture videos of the four MOOC courses. Each course is completed by 3 master students. After the summary, Given a pair of videos (a,b),students had three options:**

- **1:** *b* lecture video depend on *a* lecture video 

- **0:** *b* lecture video does not depend on *a* lecture video 

- **abandon:** can not determine the precedence relations and discards the lecture videos pairs


**The number of voting results and precedence relations in the lecture video is as follows**


| **Domin**        | **Vote for lecture videos** | **Effective voting for lecture video pairs** | **#Precedence relations** |
